# JimBot
Currently a work in progress Discord bot. Currently in the process of building out the feature set. This is a weekend project so my time is limited and this will more than likely advance at a slow pace.


##Commands
Supports a few basic commands and uses ~ (tilde) as the signal in the messages for the bot to find the commands.

- ~help <- help
- ~awake? <- tells you if Jim is still up and responding
- ~drunk? <- silly command that takes in amount of drinks over a period of time (and makes a lot of assumptions) to send back a playful response (this isn't a serious command use it at your own risk).
- ~weather <- gets the weather
